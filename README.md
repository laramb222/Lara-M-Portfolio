## Project 1: SQL - Market & Customer Analysis

The purpose of this project is to conduct a brief market and customer analysis to support future business decisions for an auto dealership. To do so, we can look at the following 3 questions:
1. Which products should we order and why?
2. How can we match marketing and communication strategies to customer behaviours?
3. How much can we spend on marketing to acquire new customers

The SQL file, database and report can be found in the SQL - Market & Customer Analysis folder.
Database, store.db, was downloaded from https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/600/stores.db

## Project 2: Python - Student Engagement Analysis

The project has the assumption that engagement with the Mr Kato online module is low and decreasing. We need to prove that. We want to then use these metrics to compare against a revision of the module that incorporates AI Chat with a digital patient and feedback with a digital preceptor. In order to do this, we will first have to:
1. Identify metrics in LRS data that we can use to measure engagement with the module.
2. Create summary statistics of the shape and volume of our data.
5. Report on engagement metrics with visualization and description.

This project is an exploratory analysis of student engagement data.

The Jupyter Notebook and report can be found in the Python - Student Engagement Analysis folder.

## Project 3: R - LPA Student Engagement

This is an expansion of the previous project, which uses the tidyLPA package in R to see if engagement is truly decreasing. 

Through a literature review, the common determiners of effort in a behavioural framework are time and effort. As the data does not provide cohort information, we will simulate the difference in engagement across cohorts (over time) by splitting the dataset in half based on the time of the first interaction.

LPA Process: The LPA was used to classify students into high, moderate, or low engagement profiles based on their engagement patterns. This allows for a deeper understanding of the distribution of engagement levels within the two groups and how these profiles differ across the two time periods.

The Jupyter Notebook, summarized report and in depth research paper can be found in the R - LPA Student Engagement folder.

## Project 4: Tableau - British Airways Review Dashboard

For my INFO419 Info Visualization course, I have had the chance to learn about data literacy and retention, and how to influence people's knowledge using data visualization. A part of this course involved using tableau to incorporate good design choices discussed in class and present information from a data set.

My process for creating this dashboard involved:

1. Researching different design principles that allowed better data retention from an audience
2. Learning how to approach using an unfamiliar software, utilizing the Tableau Learning Library and the Tableau Help page to incorporate features not taught in the classroom.
3. Taking my time to ensure that the dashboard features used were the most effective depending on the type of information I wanted to convey
The dashboard can be found below:
