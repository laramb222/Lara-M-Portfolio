## Project 1: SQL - Market & Customer Analysis

The purpose of this project is to conduct a brief market and customer analysis to support future business decisions for an auto dealership. To do so, we can look at the following 3 questions:
1. Which products should we order and why?
2. How can we match marketing and communication strategies to customer behaviours?
3. How much can we spend on marketing to acquire new customers

The SQL file, database and report can be found in the SQL - Market & Customer Analysis folder.
